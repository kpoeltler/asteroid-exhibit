                <h1>Mercury</h1>
                <p>A collision with an asteroid might have set the planet Mercury whirling oddly in its orbit, a new study suggests.</p>

                   <p>When one body orbits another — say, a moon around a planet or a planet around a star — the orbiting body often spins. Our planet experiences day and night because it spins on its axis, regularly changing which side it exposes to the sun.</p>

                    <p>However, the gravitational pull that orbiting moons and planets experience slows the rate of their spin. The most stable arrangement they can reach is to keep just one side always facing the body they are orbiting. Such "tidal locking" is why our moon always keeps the same face pointed toward Earth.</p>

                    <p>If the same were to happen with Earth and the sun, our planet would rotate once on its axis for every orbit it completed around the sun. In other words, an Earth day would be exactly as long as an Earth year, with one side receiving constant sunshine and the other experiencing perpetual night.</p>

                    <p>Scientists had long assumed that Mercury was tidally locked with the sun — the planet's tiny size and  proximity to the sun suggested the star's gravitational pull would quickly force Mercury into such a state. However, radar observations of Mercury surprisingly revealed that the planet led a far stranger life, rotating three times on its axis for every two orbits it completes around the sun. </p>


                    <img src="https://img.purch.com/h/1400/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAwOC84OTQvb3JpZ2luYWwvaW1nMi4xLmpwZw==" />

                    <p>Now, researchers suggest that Mercury was once tidally locked, initially spinning in the opposite direction to its orbit.

                    "Mercury once had a spin rate synchronous with the sun, like the moon with the Earth," study co-author Alexandre Correia, a planetary scientist at the University of Aveiro in Portugal, told SPACE.com.

                    Computer models suggest that a giant impact from an asteroid then knocked it into its current strange configuration. The space rock would have been at least 43 miles (70 kilometers) wide and 550 trillion metric tons in mass, or 1/600,000 the mass of Mercury, Correia said.

                    Evidence of this collision might include Caloris Basin, Mercury's largest impact crater, which matches the predicted size, age and location of the impact, the researchers said. "It is the perfect candidate," Correia said.

                    Such an impact might also explain certain hollows seen on Mercury's surface.</p>

                   <img src="https://img.purch.com/h/1400/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zcGFjZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzAxMi80NDMvb3JpZ2luYWwvbWVyY3VyeS1tZXNzZW5nZXItc3VyZmFjZS1sYXZhLXBob3RvLTA5MjkxMS5qcGc/MTMxNzMyMjAxNw=="/>
                <p>If the planet was tidally locked, one side would have been extremely bright and hot while the other extremely dark and cold. Substantial deposits of ice might have accumulated on the dark half, some of which might have been buried under matter ejected from impacts.

                    When Mercury's spin later changed and daylight began falling on the once dark side, this buried ice might have vaporized, leaving behind hollows, the researchers explained.

                    In addition, if Mercury was tidally locked, numerous other differences might be seen between the planet's former dark and light sides. For instance, the day-lit side would have been more viscous and thus flatter and more molten-looking, while the night side would have been more exposed to impacts and thus be more cratered.

                    "The probe Messenger, presently in Mercury's orbit, can give further insight," Correia said.

                    The results of the study were published online today (Dec. 11) in the journal Nature Geoscience.</p>

                <h1>Venus</h1>
                <p>Venus, is the second planet from our the Sun. The harsh environment makes sending spaceflights to observe the planet up close very difficult. </p>

                <h2>A day on Venus lasts longer than a year.</h2>
                <p>It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis (sidereal day). The planet’s orbit around the Sun takes
                    225 Earth days, compared to the Earth’s 365. A day on the surface of Venus (solar day) takes 117 Earth
                    days.</p>
                <h2>Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets.</h2>
                <p>This means that Venus is rotating in the opposite direction to the Sun, this is also know as a retrograde
                    rotation. A possible reason might be a collision in the past with an asteroid or other object that caused
                    the planet to alter its rotational path. It also differs from most other planets in our solar systm by
                    having no natural satellites.</p>
                <h2>Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky.</h2>
                <p>Only the Moon is brighter. With a magnitude of between -3.8 to -4.6 Venus is so bright it can be seen during
                    daytime on a clear day.</p>
                <h2>Atmospheric pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than the Earth’s.</h2>
                <p>While its size and mass are similar to Earth, the small asteroids are crushed when entering its atmosphere,
                    meaning no small craters lie on the surface of the planet. The pressure felt by a human on the surface
                    would be equivalent to that experienced deep beneath the sea on Earth.</p>

                <p>In 2017, BQ6 a sub-kilometer asteroid on an eccentric orbit, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially
                    hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately 150 meters in diameter. </p>
                <p>It was discovered on 26 January 2017, by the Space Surveillance Telescope at Lincoln Laboratory's ETS (Atom
                    Site) and passed within 6.6 lunar distances of Earth on 7 February 2017 at 6:36 UT.</p>

                <h2>potentially hazardous object (PHO)</h2>
                <p>A PHO is a near-Earth object – either an asteroid or a comet – with an orbit such that it has the potential
                    to make exceptionally close approaches to the Earth and is of a size large enough to cause significant
                    regional damage in the event of impact.[1]</p>
                <p>Most of these objects are potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), defined as having a minimum orbital intersection
                    distance with Earth of less than 0.05 AU and an absolute magnitude of 22 or brighter.[2] As of January
                    2018 there are 1,885 known PHAs (about 11% of the total near-Earth population), of which 157 are estimated
                    to be larger than one kilometer in diameter (see list of largest PHAs below).[3][4][a] Most of the discovered
                    PHAs are Apollo asteroids (1,601) and fewer belong to the group of Aten asteroids (169).

                <h2></h2>
                <p>Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted
                    that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it.
                    Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though
                    this is also not the case.</p>
                <h2>Earth has a powerful magnetic field.</h2>
                <p>This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This field
                    protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.</p>
                <h2>There is only one natural satellite of the planet Earth.</h2>
                <p>As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the Moon is the largest satellite of any planet in our
                    solar systm. In real terms, however, it is only the fifth largest natural satellite.</p>

                <h2>Amor Asteroids</h2>
                <p>The Amor asteroids are a group of near-Earth asteroids named after the asteroid 1221 Amor. They approach
                    the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. Most Amors cross the orbit of Mars. The two moons
                    of Mars, Deimos and Phobos, may be Amor asteroids that were captured by Mars' gravity. The most famous
                    member of this group is 433 Eros, which was the first asteroid to be orbited and then landed upon by
                    a human probe (NEAR Shoemaker).</p>

                <h2>433 Eros</h2>
                <p>In 2001, 433 Eros was the first asteroid to be extensively studied and ultimately landed upon by a space
                    probe (the NEAR Shoemaker mission).</p>

                <p>Two days after NEAR Shoemaker began its orbit of Eros, the spacecraft captured this rotation movie as it moved closer to the asteroid. Although a number of movies have appeared on the NEAR Web site showing all manners of fascinating surface features, this was the last taken at a great enough distance to capture the full illuminated part of the asteroid in each frame. The movie shows a full rotation on February 16, 2000, as viewed from a range of about 340 kilometers (211 miles). It nicely captures the relationship of the two major landforms, the saddle and the 5.3-kilometer (3.3-mile) diameter crater, to the rest of Eros.

                    The L4 Trojans lead Jupiter in its orbit and the L5 Trojans follow. By tradition, the L4 Trojans are
                    named for Greek characters in accounts of the Trojan War. The L5 bodies are named for characters on the
                    Trojan side of the conflict. </p>
                <p>Jupiter helped revolutionize the way we saw the universe and ourselves in 1610, when Galileo discovered Jupiter"s
                    four large moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, now known as the Galilean moons. This was the first
                    time that celestial bodies were seen circling an object other than Earth, major support of the Copernican
                    view that Earth was not the center of the universe.</p>

                <p>Lucy is a planned NASA space probe that will tour five Jupiter trojans, asteroids which share Jupiter's orbit
                    around the Sun, orbiting either ahead of or behind the planet.[1] On 4 January 2017, Lucy was chosen,
                    along with the Psyche mission, as NASA's Discovery Program missions 13 and 14 respectively.[1][2] The
                    mission is named after the 'Lucy' hominin skeleton, because the study of Trojans could reveal the "fossils
                    of planet formation": materials that clumped together in the early history of the Solar System to form
                    planets and other bodies.[3] The Australopithecus itself was named for a Beatles song, "Lucy in the Sky
                    with Diamonds".
                </p>
                <h2>Asteroid Belt</h2>
                <h3>Vesta and Ceres</h3>
                <img src="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/209_4_vesta_main.jpg" />

               <p> 4 Vesta is the second most massive body in the main asteroid belt, accounting for almost nine percent of the total mass of all asteroids. Only dwarf planet Ceres is more massive in that region of rocky debris between Mars and Jupiter. NASA’s Dawn spacecraft circled Vesta from July 16, 2011 until Sept. 5, 2012, when it departed and began its journey to dwarf planet Ceres.</p>

                <p>The giant asteroid is almost spherical, and so is nearly classified a dwarf planet. Unlike most known asteroids, Vesta has separated into crust, mantle and core (a characteristic known as being differentiated), much like Earth.</p>

                <p>Understanding why this is so was one of the objectives of the Dawn mission. The answer turned out to be that Vesta formed early, within 1 to 2 million years of the birth of the solar system. Short-lived radioactive material that was incorporated into bodies that formed during this epoch heated them to the point where—in cases like Vesta—the objects melted, allowing the denser materials to sink to the asteroid's core and the lower density materials to rise.</p>

               <p> Vesta has one of the largest brightness ranges observed on any rocky body in our solar system. The bright materials appear to be native rocks, while the dark material is believed to have been deposited by other asteroids crashing into Vesta. Scientists on the Dawn team estimate that about 300 dark asteroids with diameters ranging from one to 10 km (0.6 to six miles) hit Vesta during the last 3.5 billion years. This would have been enough to wrap the Vesta in a blanket of material about three to seven feet (one to two meters) thick.</p>

               <p> An extensive system of troughs encircles Vesta's equatorial region. The largest, named Divalia Fossa, is bigger than the Grand Canyon.

                Vesta appears to be the source of the Howardite, Eucrite and Diogenite groups of meteorites that have been found on Earth. They help scientists understand the "Lunar Cataclysm," when a repositioning of the gas-giant planets billions of years ago destabilized the orbits of asteroids in the early asteroid belt and triggered a solar-system-wide bombardment. They also provide clues to Vesta's geochemical evolution, a story that was tested and enhanced by the information Dawn provided about the asteroid's surface and interior.</p>

                <p>Vesta is believed to have lost about one percent of its mass less than a billion years ago in a massive collision responsible for the Rheasilvia crater, which is about 310 miles (500 kilometers) wide—some 95 percent of the asteroid's mean diameter. The Vesta family of asteroids is probably debris from this collision. Another huge crater is Veneneia, which is about 250 miles (400 km) in diameter.</p>

                <h2>Dawn Mission: Shedding Light on Asteroids</h2>
                <p>When NASA's Dawn mission launched in 2007, it was on its way to breaking several records. When it entered orbit around the Vesta, it became the first to orbit a main-belt asteroid. After leaving Vesta, it journeyed on to Ceres, becoming the first spacecraft to visit and then orbit a dwarf planet and the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial targets.

                    The journey hasn't been smooth. Along the way, the spacecraft lost threeof its four reaction wheels that keep it oriented. It successfully concluded its primary mission to study both targets in 2016. Once it runs out of fuel near the end of 2018, it will continue to orbit Ceres for another 50 years.

                    "To me, the real story here is how cool it is that we're exploring what, in my view, are some of the last uncharted worlds in the inner solar system," chief engineer and Dawn mission director Marc Rayman told Space.com. "Most people think of asteroids as chips of rock, but these are whole new worlds."</p>

                    <p>Dawn launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Sept. 27, 2007. Its arrived at the asteroid Vesta on July 16, 2011. The spacecraft spent almost a year in orbit around the second-largest object in the asteroid belt, departing on Sept. 5, 2012.

                        On March 6, 2015, Dawn entered orbit around Ceres. Ceres is by far the most massive object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, weighing in at nearly two-thirds the total mass of the belt. Its massive size and roundness means it qualifies as a dwarf planet. Unlike a full-size planet, a dwarf planet is a round object that fails to clear out its orbit. Dawn was just barely the first mission to arrive at a dwarf planet; NASA's New Horizons mission zipped by Pluto only a few months later (though, in fairness, New Horizons launched first but had much farther to travel).

                        Dawn traveled 1.7 billion miles (2.8 billion kilometers) to reach Vesta, then another 3.1 billion miles (4.9 billion km) to Ceres. Boosted by an ion propulsion system, the spacecraft took four days to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) at maximum throttle. Each engine produces about the same amount of force as a single piece of paper notebook paper presses against your hand.

                        Over time, however, that small force adds up. In 2010, it surpassed the previous record for velocity change held by NASA's Deep Space 1 when its accumulated acceleration over the mission exceeded 9,600 MPH (4.3 km per second).

                        "I am delighted that it will be Dawn that surpasses DS1's record," Rayman, who was a previous project manager for Deep Space 1, said in a statement. "It is a tribute to all those involved in the design and operations of this remarkable spacecraft.

                        Ion engines are extremely fuel-efficient — Dawn only carried 937 lbs. (425 kilograms) of xenon propellant at launch — but the fuel won't last forever. The spacecraft also carried 100.5 lbs. (45.6 kg) of hydrazine propellant used to change the spacecraft's orientation, and that tank is quickly running dry. Dawn is expected to run out of hydrazine fuel in the second half of 2018.

                        "When the last of the hydrazine is exhausted, the spacecraft will no longer be able to control its orientation, so it won't be able to point its solar arrays at the sun, its sensors at Ceres, nor its antenna at Earth," Rayman told Space.com in 2017. "That will be the end of Dawn's operational life."

                        Dawn will continue to orbit Ceres for decades. Planetary protection rules insisted on at least 20 years before the spacecraft crashed into the dwarf planet, to reduce the chances of contamination. The Dawn team opted to set the spacecraft on an orbit that would keep it aloft for at least 50 years.</p>
